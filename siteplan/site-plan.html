      Content
    </h2>
    <h3>Home page</h3>
    <p>
      "My name is Nathan Escujuri. I was born In Oregon to a family of six, both my parents and three siblings and have
      lived in Idaho for most of my life. Because I have grown up in Idaho I've taken up hobbies like snowboarding,
      dirtbiking, fishing, camping, boating and many other outdoors related activities. I also enjoy playing basketball,
      being with friends and family, traveling, learning about different cultures and their foods, cooking, playing
      video games, watching movies and so much more. My last name originates from Basque decent from my fathers side and
      because of that I love the culture and I believe that is where my love for travel and learning of other cultures
      comes from. I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and have been my whole life."
      Potential worded content for this page.
      This page is meant to showcase myself personally. Work aside, just my life and my interests, things that are going
      to build rapport with the reader where they can connect with me on that type of level. Its not meant to show any
      experience yet, that will be on page two. I want to display some images of myself or activites that I enjoy, again
      to connect with the audience. I want the format to be simple and clean but also show my personality within it. I
      think I can accomplish this with some ideas I have once we begin the CSS portion.

    <h3>Projects & Experience</h3>
    <p>
      "Growing up in such a innovative tech focused world, I have always been attracted to web, coding, develepment,
      hardware and software, etc. I've always enjoyed learning about all things tech and ultimately that is what I want
      to pursue in a career. I plan to finish my education at BYUI in some field of computer science so that I can use
      that knowledge and create from it. I want to display some of my projects that I have created thus far in my
      education. Through seeing these projects you will have a better idea of my expirence level in the computer science
      field and also what I'm capable of accomplishing." Potential worded content for this page.
      This will be roughly the information that I want to display on a more focused lense within this expirence page. My
      intention is that this expirience page is going to show several projects or documents, just things that are going
      to show some expirience and capabilities. Obviously this will be minor projects and not a lot of expirience but as
      I progress and improve my hope is that I continually add and change this to include better and more difficult
      projects to display. It will be just a simple page to show some work.

    <h3>Care Sales Example Website</h3>
    <p>
      This page will be a car lot catalog, a place where you can view a number of cars, their prices and information.
      This page will be to show first hand web development in an example format. I will provide adequate information
      about that cars that I choose to present on this page. The reason for this page is because I want to be able to
      show a live project website and the format of that website to show some sort of usefuleness to the reader, likely
      being employers. I think the car lot catalog will be a good way of providing this. The format, information and
      content of the page will be entered as I begin to build out the function of the site and where it will be located.
      I chose this because my intention is that page two will showcase more static projects, expiremental type data
      where this will actually show the product of web development.
