                <h2>About Myself!</h2>
                <p>My name is Nathan Escujuri. I was born In Oregon to a family of six, both my parents and three
                    siblings and have
                    lived in Idaho for most of my life. Because I have grown up in Idaho I've taken up hobbies like
                    snowboarding,
                    dirtbiking, cars, fishing, camping, boating and many other outdoors related activities. I also enjoy
                    playing basketball,
                    being with friends and family, traveling, learning about different cultures and their foods,
                    cooking, playing
                    video games, watching movies and so much more.</p>
