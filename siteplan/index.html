            <h2>About myself!</h2>
            <p> My name is Nathan Escujuri. I was born In Oregon to a family of six, both my parents and three siblings
                and have
                lived in Idaho for most of my life. Because I have grown up in Idaho I've taken up hobbies like
                snowboarding,
                dirtbiking, fishing, camping, boating and many other outdoors related activities. I also enjoy playing
                basketball,
                being with friends and family, traveling, learning about different cultures and their foods, cooking,
                playing
                video games, watching movies and so much more. </p>

            <h2>More about myself!</h2>
            <p> My last name originates from Basque decent from my fathers side and
                because of that I love the culture and I believe that is where my love for travel and learning of other
                cultures
                comes from. I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and have been my whole
                life." </p>
