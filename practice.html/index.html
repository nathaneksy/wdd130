        <p>My name is Nathan Escujuri, I grew up in Idaho in several different areas. I'm majoring in public health and plan on going to dental school following BYUI. Some of my hobbies are snowboarding, basketball, hanging out with friends and family, and lots of other things. I took this class because I find coding interesting and maybe want to have this be some sort of hobby down the road. I hope to learn more about web design and the processes it takes to build them. I've been a member of the church my whole life, I dont really have a favorite quote but I do really like listening to Elder Bednar.</p>
